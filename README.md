REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT
--------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this requirements specification document is to define the requirements of the SAPOP System - Support System for the Olympics and Parallel Games, whose main objectives are to help access to the games events that will take place in the 2016 Olympic Games and Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro.

SCOPE
--------------------------------------------------
SAPOP allows the registration and consultation of Olympic and Paralympic Games events, Olympic and Paralympic committees, players, sponsors, supporters and spectators. The organization of the Olympics will be able to manage the events (location and date), as well as distribute sponsors and supporters among the events, manufacture of licensed products and rental of intellectual property (game logo, mascot). Each committee will have a register of its players and events that they will attend. After the management of each event, an access interface will be open to the public for consultation and purchase of event tickets.
